# What is TITANIC?
TITANIC stands for _Turbine Inflow Turbulence ANalysIs Code_. This code is designed to analyze data obtained by a research-grade met tower with a focus on providing the data needed for wind energy applications, also known as _turbine inflow_. 

TITANIC can:
* Read in raw data from a meteorological tower
* Apply calibrations or remove data known to be bad
* Carry out basic quality control
* Analyze data to quantify the conditions that are being measured by the tower
* Produce statistics and data about those conditions, including
 * mean wind parameters, like speed and direction, shear, and veer.
 * turbulence parameters, such as turbulence intensity, dissipation rates, and structure functions. 
 * thermodynamics parameters, such as virtual potential temperature, monin-obukhov length, and Richardson number.
* Create plots and web pages for each data file
* Push data to an archive

# What is TITANIC used for?
TITANIC is used by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to analyze data from the National Wind Technology Center's M4 and M5 135-m towers. Find out more at https://nwtc.nrel.gov/MetData, and see the most recent data at https://nwtc.nrel.gov/M5. All plots were produced by TITANIC.
