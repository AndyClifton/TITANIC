README.txt

This directory contains files use to analyse data from the NWTC 135-m met towers. 

The following files may be particularly useful:
* Firstlook.m: the code that actually does the analysis
* AdminCodeTester.m: contains several scripts for testing out the analysis code

To make this all 'work', compile 'MainTowerOperational.m' including all of the files in 
the 'firstlook/' and 'helper_files/' directories. Use the following settings:
- windows standalone application
- compile in Matlab 2011b, x86 (wind-was11)

Copy the compiled code (m4m5qc.exe) from m4m5qc/distrib/ to Y:/wind/met135analysis/firstlook

Data are analysed using a set of scheduled tasks on wind-was10. 
You may need to stop these tasks before copying the executable.
